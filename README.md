# KeyHTTPS

This is a simple extension for Firefox. It also needs a better name. Provides
the keyboard shortcuts Control-; and Control-Y as HTTPS counterparts to
Control-L and Control-T respectively.

* Control-; just focuses on the URL bar and enters "https://".
* Control-Y opens a new tab, and then enters "https://" in the URL bar.
